# Project 3 - Agra Share

## Overview

Agra Share is a platform for users to rent out their agricultural equipment, especially the ones that are not used that often anymore, but they do not want to sell them. Lenders can create a listing, upload an image and change the loan status. Borrowers can reserve the item and contact the lender through email.

This was a 5-day team project made during our Web Development Immersive Course at General Assembly
